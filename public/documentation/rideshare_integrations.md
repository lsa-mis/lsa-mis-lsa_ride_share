# LSA RideShare Integrations

LSA RideShare integrates with the following external sites systems via API calls:
1. **[Motor Vehicle Record](https://ltp.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/mvr_auth.pdf)**: Fleet Services Motor Vehicle Record Authorization site where all drivers must complete in order to drive a car.
1. **[Canvas](https://canvas.it.umich.edu/)**: Unit specific training site where units manage training content for students who wish to drive a reserved car.
1. **[Wolverine Access](https://wolverineaccess.umich.edu/collection/all/student-wolverine-access)**: Student Enrollment system. LSA RideShare retrieves the student roster from this application.
