## Opinionated Frameworks

Ruby on Rails is an "opinionated framework", and the ModelRails Template is and even more opinionated interpretation of that. Kind of...it is more akin to ThoughtBot's playbook, a set of guidelines and best practices that we have found to be useful and have built into the way we build apps.

## Philosophy

The ModelRails Template is intended to be a reasonable starting point for building new Rails projects. To the extent possible, the things that are included are things that we have found useful AND do not constrict future developer's design** choices. The idea is to provide a well thought out starting point that can be easily modified to suit the needs of the project. 

If you find yourself constrained by something, or if you want to apply a different approach to solving a problem, we encourage you to explore and contribute to the template.

> ** The term 'design', as used here, is about the way that we structure our code more than the way that we style our user interfaces. Although some of that is true too.
