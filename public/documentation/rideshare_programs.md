## LSA RideShare Programs

1. [Duplicate Program](#duplicate-program)
1. [Create a Program](#create-a-program)

1. Edit any information that needs to be changed:
    1. If you want to create a program for the current term one of these fields should differ from the original program:
        1. Title
        2. Subject
        3. Catalog Number
        4. Class Section
    2. If the program is duplicated to a different term, Title, Subject, Catalog Number, or Class Section can be the same.
1. Select the **Term**.
1. Click on **Create Program**.
1. You will be taken to the created Program Page. You can edit the [Student List](#student-list-for-courses) and the [Sites](#lsa-rideshare-sites).

Note: All sites that the original program has been carried forward to the new program.

### Create a Program

If the program is new for the term:
1. Click on **Programs -> All Programs** in the Top Menu.
1. Click on **Create a Program Button**.
1. Fill in the form with information about the Program.
    1. Make sure to enter the Catalog Number and Class Section with all leading zeros. These fields are used to retrieve the student roster from Wolverine Access.
1. Click **Create Program**.
1. You will be taken to the created Program Page. You can edit the Student List and the Sites.

#### Not a Course Program

If the new program is not a course, follow the same steps above. In the form, you will see a  checkbox for “**Check if this program is not a course.**”

Check the checkbox if your program has no Subject, Catalog Number and Class section. The Student List for such programs should be [updated manually](#manually-add-students-to-program).
